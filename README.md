## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

! [This is an image] ()
* The two variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were "vehicle_length" and "ground_clearance".

* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value (5.35e-11)  was much lower than the significance level.  This shows that the null bypothesis in not true.

*  The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.  Because the r-squared value is 0.7149 meaning that there is a 71.5% chance that future data will fit this linear model.
